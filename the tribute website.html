                <p>The Rani of Jhansi[a] (born Manikarnika Tambe; 1828 or 1835 – 18 June 1858), also known as Rani
                    Lakshmibai, was one of the leading figures of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The queen consort of the
                    princely state of Jhansi from 1843 to 1853, she assumed its leadership after the outbreak of
                    conflict and fought several battles against the British. Her life and deeds are celebrated in modern
                    India and she remains a potent symbol of Indian nationalism.Little is known for certain about the
                    Rani's life before 1857, because there was then no need to record details about an as-yet ordinary
                    young girl. As a result, every biography of her life relies on a mixture of factual evidence and
                    legendary tales, especially when concerning her childhood and adolescence.
